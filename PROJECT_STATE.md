# Project state

Updated 2026-10-02 19:50 UTC. Draft mode (Nick, 18:28): one agent, no reviewers; merge everything and wire the app to real data. New threads resume from this file, not from old conversations.

## Where things are
- main a24a978: every team branch is merged (SIWC, analytics, realtime features, JITAI DSL and engine, AI context, Google Health API connector, test infra, data, collectors, background, interventions, and all UI screens).
- JVM modules: 3,603/3,603 tests pass on CI (run 37050667319).
- Android: the draft app builds on CI. Run 37065175047 uploads the `apks` artifact (fakeDebug, prodDebug, prodRelease). Android tests: 789/790 pass; the 1 failure is PermissionCenterJourneyTest (issue #4). The prodDebug APK scan found no test code. The repo is public since 2026-10-02, so Actions runs without billing.
- Open review findings are filed as GitHub issues #1 to #5.

## App wiring (app/src/main/kotlin/dev/agentle/app/wiring)
- Wired:
  - Timeline over the Room event table (paged).
  - Dashboard: today's steps, unlocks and screen time from stored events, plus collector status.
  - Data Sources, using the Android collectors graph.
  - Scheduler collector sweeps (usage and device).
  - Retention runs.
  - Hub clock and settings time zone.
  - AgentleApplication starts the collectors graph and BackgroundStarter.
- Still staging (app/.../staging): onboarding, permission center, insights/JITAI screens, interventions, connections (wearable, ChatGPT, AI sharing), settings ports other than the time zone, the JITAI runner, wearable sync, feature refresh.

## Next
1. Fix PermissionCenterJourneyTest (issue #4) so CI goes green.
2. Wire the remaining staging ports (permission center and onboarding next, then JITAI screens over JitaiDefinitionStore, then settings deletion and retention).
3. Reviews, issues #1 to #5, the 36-step scenario and the final report, when the budget allows.

## Rules
Never use the legacy Fitbit Web API (Google Health API only). Agents work token-efficiently: targeted reads and tests, full suite only before completion. Update this file after each major milestone.
